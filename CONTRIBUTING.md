## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, performance issues, or have feature requests, please report them on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/miners-online/.github/issues) page. When reporting an issue, please fill out the provide templates.

Issues that do not follow the templates will be rejected.

### 2. Feature Requests and Discussions

We encourage the community to discuss new ideas, feature requests, or improvements in our [GitHub Discussions](#) forum. This is the best place to brainstorm and refine ideas before implementing them. Be sure to specify which repository or project your idea pertains to.

### 3. Submitting Pull Requests

If you would like to contribute code to one of the Miners Online repositories, follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Right Repository:** Identify the correct repository within the Miners Online organization for your contribution.

2. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the relevant repository to your GitHub account.

3. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. Use a descriptive name for the branch, such as `feature/add-new-tool` or `bugfix/fix-teleport-issue`.

4. **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes, ensuring that your code follows our coding standards (see below).

5. **Test Your Changes:** Thoroughly test your code in a local environment to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce new issues.

6. **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message. Then push the branch to your GitHub fork.

7. **Open a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request to the original repository in the Miners Online organization from your forked branch. In your pull request, provide a detailed explanation of what your changes do and why they should be merged.

8. **Address Feedback:** Be prepared to make revisions based on feedback from project maintainers or other contributors.

### 4. Code Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency across all repositories, please adhere to the following standards:

- **Code Style:** Follow consistent naming conventions, indentation, and formatting.
- **Commit Style:** Follow the Conventional Commits standard. More information on the [Conventional Commits Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13) by *@qoomon*.
- **Documentation:** Ensure your code is well-documented, especially for complex functions or classes. Use comments where necessary to explain the purpose and logic of your code.
- **Performance Considerations:** Keep performance in mind. Avoid introducing changes that could negatively impact the server’s performance.
- **Modularity:** Whenever possible, write modular and reusable code to make it easier for others to build upon your work.
